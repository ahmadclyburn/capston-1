This CLI is a Accounting Ledgar that does basic functions like: reading a rile, writing to a file, and displaying and navigating menus.
I had a hard time in the beginning after getting the general skeletons of the program going, but after i got the specific reports to display teh accurate information from the file
I got into as flow with having everything fall into place.

These are photos of teh main menus. the title of the are fairly straight forward and tell you exactly what your going to get out of each menu space. 
The one special thing i did in my project was make it slightly personal with making the csv file about a show that i really like instead of generic data.
