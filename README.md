This CLI is a Accounting Ledgar that does basic functions like: reading a rile, writing to a file, and displaying and navigating menus.
I had a hard time in the beginning after getting the general skeletons of the program going, but after i got the specific reports to display teh accurate information from the file
I got into as flow with having everything fall into place.
